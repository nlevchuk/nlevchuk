### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack engineer with over a decade of experience building web applications across industries including international shipping, productivity tools, and business management platforms. My focus has always been on delivering clean, maintainable code and improving the quality, usability, and performance of the systems I work on.

My core technical strengths lie in Ruby and JavaScript. Iâ€™ve worked extensively with React, Hotwire (Turbo + Stimulus), Node.js, PostgreSQL, and GraphQL, developing both customer-facing interfaces and internal tools. Iâ€™m also experienced with containerization and CI/CD processes using Docker and Kubernetes.
